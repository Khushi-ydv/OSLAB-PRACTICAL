# 🖥️ OS Lab Assignment 3 – Scheduling, File Allocation & Memory Management Simulation

## 📌 Description
This repository contains a **Python-based simulation** of multiple Operating System concepts as required in **ENCS351 – Operating Systems Lab**.
The assignment demonstrates:

- CPU Scheduling Algorithms  
- File Allocation Strategies  
- Memory Allocation Techniques  

All tasks use only Python built‑in modules.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 🧮 Task 1: CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- Priority Scheduling  
- Round Robin Scheduling  

### 📁 Task 2: Sequential File Allocation
Simulates allocation based on starting block, file length, and block availability.

### 📚 Task 3: Indexed File Allocation
- Uses an index block  
- Maps data blocks  
- Detects duplicate or already allocated blocks  

### 💾 Task 4: Contiguous Memory Allocation
- First Fit  
- Best Fit  
- Worst Fit  

### 🧱 Task 5: Memory Management (MFT & MVT)
- MFT: Fixed partitions  
- MVT: Variable partitions for efficient space usage
