--- Task 3: Zombie & Orphan Processes ---

## Zombie Simulation ##
--> The script is running. Quickly open a terminal in VS Code and run:
    ps -el | grep defunct
    
[NOTE: The following is the expected output in a separate terminal during the 20-second sleep period.]
F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
0 Z  1000   609   608  0  80   0 -     0 wait   ?        00:00:00 zombie_maker <defunct>


## Orphan Simulation ##
--- Task 3: Creating an Orphan Process ---
Parent (615) is launching a child process.
Parent (615) is exiting immediately, orphaning the child.

Parent script has finished. The child is now an orphan running in the background.
Waiting for the child to finish and write its output...

--- Contents of child_output.txt ---
Child (616) started with parent 1.
Child (616) is now an orphan, adopted by parent 1.

--- Task 4: Inspecting Process Info from /proc ---
Enter the PID to inspect (e.g., this notebook's kernel: 450): 91

--- Details for Process PID: 91 ---

[+] Process Status:
  - Name:	code
  - State:	S (sleeping)
  - Pid:	91
  - PPid:	34
  - VmRSS:	  340156 kB

[+] Executable Path: Not accessible.

--- Task 5: Process Prioritization ---
--- Task 5: Process Prioritization (Jupyter Robust Version) ---
Launching 3 child processes with nice values: [15, 0, -10]...
Waiting for them to complete...

--- Results ---
PID: 679    | Requested Nice: -10 | Actual Nice: 0   | Duration: 2.24s
PID: 678    | Requested Nice: 0   | Actual Nice: 0   | Duration: 2.33s
PID: 677    | Requested Nice: 15  | Actual Nice: 15  | Duration: 2.37s

--- Simulation Complete ---
✅ Notice how the process that 'Requested Nice: -10' did not crash.
   Instead, it ran at the default 'Actual Nice: 0' because of the error handling.
